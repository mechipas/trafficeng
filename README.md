# Traffic Engineering
This repository contains all of our notebooks for exercise sessions in traffic modelling taken in the Traffic Engineering course.  It introduces the 4 step model and guides the students through each of the steps interactively. It also provides some first insights into the differences between deterministic and stochastic route choice and congested vs uncongested traffic models (DUN, DUE, SUN, SUE).
# Getting Started
Some first thoughts here: It seems useful to utilize some plattform that allows running of notebooks in the cloud for students to use our code without having the hassle of setting up an environment. After a bit of digging and comparisons https://mybinder.org/ seems like the best solution here, it's open source and very neatly interfaces with repositories that are kept within gitlab/hub. The functionality is straight forward: provide a github/gitlab repository filled with your notebooks and some dependency specification either in the form of a requirements.txt (pip) or .yml file (conda). Binder will then build an environment for you and provide the corresponding kernel together with computational resources so that you can run the notebooks straight from the browser. The perfect setup for our exercise (or at least so it seems!).
