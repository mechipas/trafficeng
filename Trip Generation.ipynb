    "# Trip Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook (prepared by Gaurav) is supposed to be a part of a bigger excercise that takes us sequentially through various steps involved in the traditional demand modelling. By this time, we would have already defined our network i.e. nodes (including centroids) and links (along with link attributes). At this stage, we are already capable of ascertaining which path (or links) will the driver likely use if he/she needs to go from a particular origin to a particular destination i.e. shortest path calculation. What we need to predict ultimately in a demand model is how many drivers there will be on each link of the network. It's quite logical to see that the missing gap between our current capability and the desired capability is the capability to predict how many drivers would want to undertake a trip in between each of the OD pairs. This missing gap is filled in two steps. In the first step, we find out how many trips are produced i.e. have their origins at each centroid (zone) and how many trips are attracted i.e. have their destination at each centroid (zone). Then in the 2nd step, we try to find the destinations of the trips whose origin we know and origins of the trips whose destination we know in order to have our full OD matrix. It's the first of these two steps that we will focus on in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB**: After these two steps i.e. after having our OD matrix, we can realise our ultimate goal of predicting link flows by performing a traffic assignment step which is analogous to carrying out shortest path calculation (though not always the same - think about stochastic choices and congestible links)."

    "### Adding zonal data\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the first step in predicting how many trips a zone may attract or produce is to ascertain which kind of variables may influence them e.g. if a zone has a lot of offices or a lot shops then it is expected to attract a lot of trips; however, if it's a residential area, then the no. of trips produced will most likely outweigh the no. of trips attracted. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NB:** Trips from a certain place e.g. office/shop to home are still considered to be produced by home and not by the office/shop. This is because otherwise there would be no difference between production and attraction as everyone will eventually return to home. However, this is as an exception only for home based trips. **PAUL PLEASE CONFIRM?** e.g. A trip starting from shop A to shop B is considerd to be produced by shop A (and attracted by shop B) but a trip from shop A back to home is considered to be produced by home. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will consider the following variables to affect productions and attractions for a zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Number of households\n",
    "2. Average household size\n",
    "3. Average number of driving license holders per household\n",
    "4. Average household income (in units of 1.000 euros)\n",
    "5. Office space (in units of 1.000 m2)\n",
    "6. Retail space (in units of 1.000 m2)\n",
    "\n",
    "You may think of some other factors that influence trip production or attraction and use them in the prediction provided you have enough measurements both for calibration (parameter estimation) and validation of the prediction model."

    "### Computing productions and attractions\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine the trip productions and attractions, we use a linear regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the trip attractions $A_j$, a regression model has already been estimated and is given by the following equation:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "A_{J}& = 52.5 \\times O{j} + 15.8 \\times R_{j}&(1) \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}                                                                                               \n",
    "\n",
    "where $O_j$ is the amount of office space (in units of 1.000 m2) in zone j and $R_j$ is the amount of retail space (in units of 1.000 m2) in zone j.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Q:** *The regression model for attraction doesn't take into account any of the characteristics of the households. Why is that? Can such a model give good predictions?*\n",
    "*The answer lies in our introductory discussion of this section.*\n",
    "\n",
    "For the trip productions $P_i$ is determined by $P_i = H_i \\times T_i$ where $H_i$ is the number of households in zone i and $T_i$ is the average number of trips a household makes in zone i. This average number of trips will be determined by the following linear regression model:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "T_{i}& = \\beta_1 \\times S{i} + \\beta_2 \\times L_{i} + \\beta_3 \\times I_{i}&(2) \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}  \n",
    "                                                                                                   \n",
    "where $S_i$ is the average household size, $L_i$ is the average number of driver’s license holders in a household, and $I_i$ is the average household income (in units of 1000 euro’s). \n",
    "The parameters $\\beta_1, \\beta_2$ and $\\beta_3$ have to be estimated using the household data ( $S_i$, $L_i$ & $I_i$ ) that has already been presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we move on to the estimation of these parameters, let's talk a bit about the model $P_i = H_i \\times T_i$. This model, inherently, assumes that the no. of trip productions are not influenced by the presence of anything other than houses (e.g. shops and offices). \n",
    "- **Q:** How good is this assumption? Try to think **beyond** our introductory discussion of this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The answer actually depends on our study interests. If we are talking about inter-city networks with bigger zones, **may be** it's a good enough assumption but it can be erroneous if we are working at a more detailed level with very small sized zones. Hint: Think about what happens to the bike traffic during lunch/dinner hours if our study area is Leuven and our zones are small parts inside the ring. Further hint: Think about delivery services in general.* \n",
    "\n",
    "Coming back to **parameter estimation**, we will use a least squares minimisation of the errors (minimisation of $E^TE$). We will represent the eq. 2 in the form $A\\beta = T$, where A will form the input matrix now including the input data $S_i$, $L_i$ & $I_i$ in each row and T will be the output matrix. Then, $\\beta = pseudoinv(A) \\times T$ gives us our estimation of the three parameters.   \n",
